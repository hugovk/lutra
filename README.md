## Elevator pitch

<!-- start elevator-pitch -->

Lutra is a theme for [Sphinx] documentation, with the goal of improving the functionality, usability and design available in Sphinx-based documentation websites.

- **Statically awesome** â€” powered by [Sphinx], enabling the use of the _huge_ ecosystem of plugins and extensions.
- **Responsive** â€” works across all sorts of screen resolutions.
- **Customisable** â€” tweak how it looks, through a bunch of CSS variables.
- **Clear typography** â€” borrowing the design language of this decade's websites.
- **Capable navigation** â€” scales with large documentation sets.
- **Capable search** â€” help readers find what they want quickly.
- **Modern architecture** â€” built with modern tooling (`sphinx-theme-builder`, Tailwind, `webpack`, and more).

## Quickstart

<!-- start quickstart -->

To use the theme in your existing Sphinx documentation:

1. Install Lutra in documentation's build environment.

   ```console
   $ pip install lutra
   ```

1. Update the `html_theme` in `conf.py`. If there's any configuration variables that start with `html_` in this file, comment them out.

   ```py
   html_theme = "lutra"
   ```

1. Your Sphinx documentation's HTML pages will now be generated with this theme! ðŸŽ‰

## What's with the name?

I plucked this out of the scientific name for [The Eurasian otter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_otter): _Lutra lutra_. You can decide whether I picked the first one or the second one.
